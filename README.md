# express_admin_user_api


in this api file we dont have any view and in the routes file we use controllers file functions

so if you want to see methods and functions you have to use controllers

in the controllers we have two folder that contains routes and controls...in almost routes in routers we first checked forms and datas

then we sent anything else
